## Introduction
This is a simple project in MAUI to help managing storage.
The main object is a "box" (cant be any storage unit) that can :
1/ contains items
2/ be marked with multiple content types (like "tools", "electronic equipment", "arduino", etc)
3/ have a complete description
4/ have as many photos as needed

## Features
- Add a box
- Remove a box
- Edit a box
- Add one or more photos to a box
- Remove one or more photos from a box
- List all boxes
- Search boxes by content type
- Search boxes by description
- Search boxes by box number
- Search boxes by photo

There are also maintenance features:
- Backup all data
- Restore all data
- Delete all data

## Code quality
At this stage, the product is running, but the code is not clean and not optimized.
I spend more time to fight against MAUI bugs than to write clean code... Mostly because of Shell problems (like transient VM that are not transient).
I will clean the code later, when MAUI will be more stable.

## Next steps
- Waiting for Microsoft to stabilize MAUI and the Shell
- Clean the code
- Open the project to the community and add contributors if some are interested in this project
- Add Windows support
- Add MacOS support
- Add iOS support
